## Reporting bugs and opening issues

If you'd like a report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a 👍.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

## Coding Guidelines

### Pull Requests
We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into Graph Kit.

If you've got an idea for a change then please discuss it in the open first, by opening an issue.

If you're looking for something to work on, have a look at the open issues in the repository [here](https://github.com/jsuyash1514/Graph-Kit/issues).

> We don't have a set format for Pull requests, but we expect you to list changes, bugs generated and other relevant things in PR message.

### Git Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
